description: "The Birds' Christmas Carol is a novel by Kate Douglas Wiggin printed\
  \ privately in 1886 and published in 1888 with illustrations by Katharine R. Wireman.\
  \ Wiggin published the book to help fund the Silver Street Free Kindergarten, which\
  \ she founded in 1878.\nThe story is about Carol Bird, a Christmas-born child, a\
  \ young girl who is unusually loving and generous, having a positive effect on everyone\
  \ with whom she comes into contact. She is the youngest member of her family and\
  \ has several devoted older brothers. At about the age of 5, Carol contracts an\
  \ unspecified illness (possibly tuberculosis), and, by the time she is 10, she is\
  \ bedridden; physicians say that she does not have long to live. Most of the brief\
  \ novel's plot involves Carol making plans for a Christmas celebration for the nine\
  \ Ruggles children, a poor, working-class family living near the Birds.\nWiggin's\
  \ story is primarily a moral tale about a saintly child, but unlike many other such\
  \ stories of the period, Carol is refreshingly intelligent and cheerful instead\
  \ of pious. The story is also enlivened by many humorous touches, particularly in\
  \ the scenes of the Ruggles family's home life.\nIn 1917, the story was adapted\
  \ as the silent movie \"A Bit o' Heaven\" starring Mary Louise as Carol, Donald\
  \ Watson and Ella Gilbert as Mr. and Mrs. Bird and Mary Talbot as Mrs. Ruggles.\n\
